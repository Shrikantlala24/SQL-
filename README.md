## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the SQL scripts in this repository, you'll need:
- A SQL database management system (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server, etc.)
- A SQL client or IDE (MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, DBeaver, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shrikantlala24/SQL-.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd SQL-
   ```

3. Open your preferred SQL client and connect to your database

4. Run the SQL scripts as needed

## 💡 Usage

Each SQL file in this repository is self-contained and can be executed independently. You can:
